# EdTech-App-Lead-Conversion-Scoring-
An education company sells online courses to industry professionals. On any given day, many professionals who are interested in the courses land on their website and browse for courses. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Once person land on the website, he/she might browse the courses or fill up a form for the course or watch some videos. When person fill up a form providing their email address or phone number, the person is classified to be a lead. Moreover, the company also gets leads through past referrals. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc. Through this process, some of the leads get converted while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at company is around 30%. There are a lot of leads generated in the initial stage (top) but only a few of them come out as paying customers from the end. In the middle stage, we needed to nurture the potential leads well (i.e., educating the leads about the product, constantly communicating etc.) in order to get a higher lead conversion. Company has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e., the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers. The company requires to build a model wherein we needed to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark of the target lead conversion rate to be around 80%. 

 
Project Roadmap 
To build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. 

To adjust if the company's requirement changes in the future so we need to handle these as well.
